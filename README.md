Sitting by the campfire is now just a little more comfortable. Lit campfires now give nearby players Regeneration or Farmer's Delight's Comfort.

Comfortable Campfires can either be installed only on the server, or on the client if using the mod in singleplayer.

## Installation

Comfortable Campfires is a serverside mod for Fabric and Forge.
- On Fabric, [Farmer's Delight (Fabric)](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight-fabric) is recommended.
- On Forge, [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight) is recommended.

If Farmer's Delight is not installed, regeneration will be applied instead of comfort.

## Credits

This mod was inspired by the Campfire Heal script present in the [Raspberry Flavoured](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/raspberry-flavoured) modpack, with the added benefit of also working on the server (and on Fabric!)
